## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please open an issue or contact the maintainers privately. We will address all reports promptly and keep you informed of progress.

- Please do not disclose security issues publicly until they have been resolved.
- When reporting, include as much information as possible to help us reproduce and fix the issue.

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe!
